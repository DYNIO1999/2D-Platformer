## Light-In-Darkness
Platformer 2D in OpenGL simple project



# TO DO:
- Implement 2D Renderer
    - Abstraction:
        - OpenGL buffers - [x]
            
        - Shaders 
            - SetUniforms
            - Create Shader from string 
            - Create Shader from filepath
            - Bind shader or use it method
            - Retriving all shader uniforms and storing it i container for quick check up.

    - Architecture
    - Minimize the number of drawing calls
    - Placing a lot of geometry data in a single buffer object and batching it all up into a single glDrawâ€¦ 
- Implement Mesh
    - Box/Quad
    - Circle
    - Polygon ??
- Implement Material
 
- Camera
- Movement Of Object
- Physics:

- Implement Lights
